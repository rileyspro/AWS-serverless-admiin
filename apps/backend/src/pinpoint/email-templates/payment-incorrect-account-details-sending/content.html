            <p>Dear {{user.firstName}},</p>
            <p>
              We regret to inform you that the bank account details you provided
              to receive payments from your contacts are incorrect.
            </p>
            <p>
              We received a payment for invoice
              <strong>{{task.reference}}</strong> but have returned the funds
              due to incorrect receiving bank account details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please update your bank account details as soon as possible to
              avoid any payment issues.
            </p>
            <p>

              us.
